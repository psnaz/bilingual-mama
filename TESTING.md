#### **User Stories**

The target audience (end users) of this project are bilingual females (but also males) from the age of 25+ who live abroad and are looking for hands-on information about raising bilingual children in an environment where the minority (their own) language is not spoken readily. It is aimed at this type of audience as my personal story (“bilingual mum of two trying to bring up her children bilingual so that they can understand and speak her language as natives”) can resonate with them.

The end user is looking for inspiration and hands-on advice and how-tos, not scientific theories.

The benefit of this project is to highlight that bilingual parenting can be a very tricky and time-consuming task however, if you have a sound ‘strategy and you persist, you will “bear the fruit of your labour” eventually, as long as you’re patient and consistent.

Other features that are not to be missed is that the users can, if they wish, get in touch to obtain more parenting advice by sending a contact form and also asking questions when commenting on the relevant blog posts. They can also easily navigate to the social links.
